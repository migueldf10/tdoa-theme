# Wordpress theme development environment starter

Gulp set up to: 

- Use SASS and compile it to minified css
- Parse js through babel and merge all files in one
- Watch all files and rebuild on changes (also changes on php)
- Use browsersync to proxy your localhost dev server to load changes on save!
